The hotel reservation contract can be found [here](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x65A8aa6334A500Da1dA420Bc5E965c55E3BD7f21). Let us go through its main ``bookRoom()`` function\n",

    "- Note that no part of the contract allows for cancellation of the reservation; this Dapp corresponds to a Non-refundable reservation\n",
    "\n",
    "You will now book accommodation for the trip. \n",
    "- Go to the contract on Etherscan, click the write contract tab, and connect your wallet. - - Click the [bookRoom()](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x65A8aa6334A500Da1dA420Bc5E965c55E3BD7f21#writeContract#F2) tab. \n",
    "- Set the amount of Wei to send as a payment. The required payment is `10000000000 wei` or `0.00000001 ETH` (recommend); you can send more if you want, and the contract will refund it within the same transaction.\n",
    "- Check the status of your reservation by querying `CheckReservations` with your public key\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have booked the accommodation, let us book a flight. The flight reservation contract looks similar to the hotel reservation contract with ``bookFlight()`` replacing ``bookRoom()``. You can access the flight reservation contract [here](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x27dD8de8c733c546FeEa68bE6CeFBFFb7Bb8A219). Perform the same steps as the hotel reservation contract to book a flight ticket. Check the status of the transaction on Etherscan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the transaciton will fail for some of you since there aren't enough flight tickets available for all class members. This leads to a situation where your hotel reservation is practically useless since there is no way to travel. Is it possible to avoid such a situation: *Book hotel only if the flight is available* and *Book flight only if the hotel is available*? In other words, we want the trip reservation to be atomic - Either book both travel and accommodation or book none. Notice that the Dapps are independent of one another - think of them as two separate travel websites. \n",

    "## Atomic transaction\n",
    "\n",
    "We can perform such transactions easily on blockchains. Note that an ethereum transaction either succeeds or fails and reverts back. Thus, we need to combine ``bookRoom()`` and ``bookFlight()`` into a single transaction. \n",

    "- The last part disburses any remaining refund.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have refreshed both the hotel and flight contracts, and you will now use the atomic transaction contract to book both atomically:\n",
    "- Go to the contract on Etherscan, click the write contract tab, and connect your wallet. - - Click the [bookTrip](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xa67990332E026b6c4AC71937BbE44207d97c113a#writeContract#F1) tab. \n",
    "- Set the amount of ETH to send as a payment. The required total payment is `20000000000 wei` or `0.00000002 ETH`; anything extra will be refunded. \n",
    "- Give the contract addresses of the hotel and flight reservation contract; set the price of both to ``10000000000`` wei.\n",
    "- Check the status of the transaction on Etherscan\n",
    "\n",
    "The transaction will succeed for some of you and fail for the rest. Check the status of your booking on the respective contracts. If the atomic transaction failed, you should not have confirmed reservations on both the hotel and flight contracts. "
